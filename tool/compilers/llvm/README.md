# LLVM

## Summary

Contains *The LLVM Project* (`llvm`) source code
and a build system overlay for `llvm`.

Specific versions may be built by checkout out a
particular release from the `src` directory.

For example:

```
cd src

# show releases
git branch -r

# decide on version 15 and check it out.
git checkout origin/release/15.x

# change your mind and select the trunk.
git checkout origin/main
```
