# Water

A collection of useful, standalone projects with
a special emphasis on *C++*.

Every internal project is self-consistent and
self-contained. The projects here, while mostly
header-only, are always accompanied by an
"example" program. The examples have been written
to be *used* as much as they are meant to be *shown*.
*Water*, the name, represents this project's
modularity and self-consistency.
